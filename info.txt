Feature Round:
Question 1: Book Rental Application
You can build a book rentals application that will allow to perform the following actions.
Create a User and Admin account
CRUD operations with books: Create new book listing, Edit a book listing, Delete a book listing
Show users if a book is available to rent or not
 
Book info should contain-
Isbn number(It is property of book which is unique for each book), Name, Author, PublishedOn, AddedOn
 
Apis should be as follows for CRUD on books
GET /book/list -> returns all books
POST /book/create -> add new book 
POST /book?delete=true  (should accept one of the 3 query params -> delete, rent, return) -> should delete/Rent/Return book
GET /rented/{userId} -> return all books rented by user

Question 2: Enhancement

User should not be able to rent more than 2 books at a time
Admin should not be able to add duplicate books

-------------------------------------
1. No two books should have same Isbn
2. Mainly - User(role: regular user/admin) & Book
3. Special priviliges for Admin
